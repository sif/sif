"A loop device is a pseudo ("fake") device (actually just a file) that acts as a block-based device."



["Linux Creator Linus Torvalds: I Love My MacBook Air!"](https://www.cultofmac.com/162823/linux-creator-linus-torvalds-i-love-my-macbook-air/)



To disable desktop effects:

- Alt+Shift+F12 or
- compiz-config settings



**Package manager vs dependency manager**

Package manager manages for system

Dependency manager manages for projects



## QEMU

When building qemu, use: `su -`

Before using qemu, check to see if kqemu is there: `ls -l /dev/kqemu`

If not:

1. `su`
2. `modprobe kqemu`
3. `chmod 666 /dev/kqemu`

Create an image for qemu to work on:
`qemu-img create image.img 10GB`

To qemu the image: `qemu image.img`

Example:

`qemu -cpu coreduo -m 1024 -usb -cdrom /dev/cdrom -boot d sif.img`



## Commands

["Permissions of 644 mean that the owner of the file has read and write access, while the group members and other users on the system only have read access."](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/modify-file-permissions-with-chmod/)

`kill -9`
"It is a forceful way to kill/terminate a or set of processes."
"This signal cannot be handled (caught), ignored or blocked."

To copy a file from one server to another:

```
scp username@ipA:/path_to_file username@ipB:/path_to_file
```

To get current server's domain name:
`hostname`

When told that the drive is still in use:

```
lsof /dev/cdrom
kill [pid]
```

(lsof is "list open files")

To rip from optical to disk:

```
dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/sif/???.iso bs=2048
```

To find desired program running:

```
ps aux | grep [???]
```

Find out how much space you have and how much space you are using:

```
df -h
```

(df is "display free disk space")

To find the path to startx:

```
which startx
```

To make fwlogwatch easier to use:

```
cp -vp /usr/local/sbin/fwlogwatch /usr/bin/fwlogwatch
```

Make reading logs easier:

```
fwlogwatch /var/log/messages > /home/sif/messages
fwlogwatch /var/log/syslog > /home/sif/syslog
```

If you want to check your server's current tracked connections, just run the following:

```
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_count
```

If you want to adjust it, just run the following as root:

```
echo 123456 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max
```

It is better to use rsync with trial run than use diff for data comparison, dir1 is source:

```
rsync -av --dry-run dir1/ dir2/
```

Back up command, make sure the source is the only place you make changes to:

```
rsync -av --delete /home/sif/ /mnt/[usb?]/sif/
```

Syncing based on level (1 level):

```
rsync -av --delete --exclude="/*/" /home/sif/ /mnt/[usb?]/sif/
```

Syncing based on level (3 levels):

```
rsync -av --delete --exclude="/*/*/*/" /home/sif/ /mnt/[usb?]/sif/
```

Cataloging command:

```
ls -R > ls.txt
tree > tree.txt
```

Update the system time:

```
ntpdate pool.ntp.org && hwclock --systohc
```

Fixing flash problem, remove the one in:

```
~/.mozilla/plugins
```

Difference between `rsync /exampleA/ /exampleB/` and `rsync /exampleA /exampleB`: the difference is whether or not you want the folder itself

The steps I took to change empathy from FAT32 to ext3:

1. `fdisk /dev/sdb`
2. `mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1`
3. `chown sif:sif /mnt/empathy`
4. `rsync -av --delete /mnt/source/ /mnt/empathy/`

To see if there is any difference although it's really not necessary with rsync:

```
diff -req /mnt/affinity/ /mnt/empathy/
```

Do smartctl for hard drives

modinfo works on actual modules, not aliased names:

```
modinfo
```

```
cat /proc/sys/net/nf_conntrack
```

```
lsmod
grep conntrack /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.alias
```
