40 MB hard drive was a thing. We now have several GB to TB.

Speed of hard drive have also drastically improved. From 0.1 MB / second to 500 MB / second.

### Solid State Drive

#### M.2 SSD

SATA M.2 SSD, 6 pins and 5 pins wide

NVMe M.2 SSD, just 5 pins wide

## RAM

640 KB RAM was a thing. We now easily have 8-16 GB RAM or more.

## Modem

Motorola Surfboard SB5100 Cable Modem

## Floppy Disk

1.44 MB floppy disks was a thing. You now have GB in disks the size of a lipstick.

## Uptime

Highest uptime: 46 days

## Interfaces

All this will be outdated in a few years because of the speed at which technology improves but new technology is based on and developed from old technology.
