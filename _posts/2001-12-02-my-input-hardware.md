Switches
- Linear actuation - quiet than tactile, no resistance from bump, smoother
- Tactile actuation - a bump before actuation

There doesn't seem to be a way to find the "best keyboard" as there are a lot of options now, some things to consider:

- How custom do you want your keyboard to be?
- Do you want it to be programmable?
- Do you want clicky keys or not? How loud do you want it?
- How much force of actuation do you want?
- Do you want RGB?
- What about the build quality?
- Do you want to be able to put custom keycaps? Or if you already own some, be able to use them?
- What shape do you want the board? Look up split keyboard for an example
- What layout do you like?

This is all largely preferences.
