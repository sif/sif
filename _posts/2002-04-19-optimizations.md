## Discrete Optimization



### Knapsack

"The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves choosing a set of items from a collection to maximize the total value of the items, subject to a constraint on the total weight of the items. It is a classic problem in computer science and operations research, and it has many practical applications, such as packing items for a trip or selecting investments for a portfolio.

The knapsack problem can be represented using a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to select a subset of the items that maximizes the total value of the items, without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.

There are many algorithms and techniques that can be used to solve the knapsack problem, including dynamic programming, branch and bound, and heuristics. The efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms can vary depending on the specific details of the problem."

### Local Search



### Linear Programming

"Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. It is a method for finding the maximum or minimum value of a function that is subject to certain constraints."

"The "Simplex Algorithm" is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems, which involve finding the optimal solution to a set of linear constraints."

"The "Interior Point Algorithm" is another algorithm for solving linear programming problems, which involves finding the optimal solution by moving towards the interior of the feasible region."



### Mixed Integer Programming

"Mixed integer programming is a type of mathematical optimization problem that involves a mix of continuous and discrete variables. It is a generalization of linear programming, which only involves continuous variables.

In mixed integer programming, the objective function and the constraints are still represented by linear equations, but some of the variables in the problem can be either continuous or discrete. This allows for a greater degree of flexibility and more realistic modeling of many optimization problems."
