## Basics

Data structure is just a way to organize data

User defined data structures are either linear or non-linear

Linear (array, linked list, stack, queue) vs non-linear (graph, tree)

set is faster than list (hint: look at its implementation, but don't forget trade-offs)

Common operations: inserting, deleting, sorting, searching, merging, traversing

ADT:

1. Operations
2. Data Structure
3. Error Conditions

Program $$ \leftrightarrow $$ ADT (functions, data)

All primitives are ADT

Primitive data structures:

- int (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- float (1.0, 1.1, etc.)
- character ('a', 'b', etc.)
- pointer (\*, \*\*, etc.)
- boolean (true, false)



unsigned integers
integers that are always positive, examples: memory addresses, color values (RGB)

signed integers




## 

Consider LIFO (last in first out) and FIFO (first in first out)

- Queue = first in first out
- Stack = last in first out

infix, prefix, postfix
