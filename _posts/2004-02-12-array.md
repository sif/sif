##

Arrays are contiguous

An array stores data sequentially, usually starting at 0 based index

Linear array or one dimensional array, static in size

Dynamic array and hash map are built on array

Fixed-size, elements located by index or address

Strengths:

1. constant-time access
2. space efficiency
3. memory locality

Weaknesses:

1. fixed size
2. costly inserts and deletes

Rotated array simply means an array that has shifted to the right or left by a number of steps, the element from one end will move to the other end



## Runtime Complexity

lookup $$ O(1) $$ fast lookup
append $$ O(1) $$ fast append
insert $$ O(n) $$
delete $$ O(n) $$



## Space Complexity

$$ O(n) $$



## Dynamic Arrays

If a dynamic array is full, it copies its content to a larger array

std::vector



## Multidimensional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays are simply nested arrays that allow for multiple dimensions



### Two Dimensional Array



### Three Dimensional Array



## [Strings](https://www.afterlifesong.com/data_structures/2004/05/15/strings.html)

Strings and arrays are often interchangeable
