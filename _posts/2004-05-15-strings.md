## Exercises

- Find the first non-repeated character in a string.
- Reverse a string iteratively and recursively.
- Determine if 2 strings are anagrams.
- Check if string is a palindrome.
- Check if a string is composed of all unique characters.
- Determine if a string is an int or a double.
- Find the shortest palindrome in a string.
- Print all permutations of a string.
- Given a single-line text string and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right.
- Given a list of strings, write a function in Python to return all the strings that are anagrams.
