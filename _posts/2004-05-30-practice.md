## Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)

There are many variations to this, such as whether or not repeats are allowed, negative numbers being a possibility, etc.

```python3
def solution1(test, desired_result):
    solution_set = []
    
    for number in test:
        needed = desired_result - number
        if needed in test:
            solution_set.append((number, needed))
    
    return solution_set

#test = [1,2,4,3,1,3,1,4,5,15,5,2,3,5,4] # [(5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5)]
test = [1, 9, 4] # [(1, 9), (9, 1)]
print(solution1(test, 10))
```

## Find the most frequent integer in an array

```python3
test1 = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1] # Expected output: 1
test2 = [10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 20, 20] # Expected output: 20

def solution(test):
    counter = {}

    for number in test:
        if str(number) in counter:
            counter[str(number)] += 1
        else:
            counter[str(number)] = 1

    return max(counter, key=counter.get)

print(solution(test1))
print(solution(test2))
```

## Find the only element in an array that only occurs once

```python3
def solution(test):
    count = {}

    for number in test:
        if str(number) not in count:
            count[str(number)] = 1
        else:
            count[str(number)] += 1

    return  min(count, key=count.get)

test1 = [12, 1, 12, 3, 12, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3] # 2
test2 = [10, 20, 10, 30, 10, 30, 30] # 20
print(solution(test2))
```
