Vector Linux 4.3 === Slackware 9.1.0, Kernel v2.6.7-ide4



If for some reason a problem is encountered, it is most likely some permission-related problem. Modify it accordingly.

Remove the default MPlayer that came with 4.3 and install MPlayer-0.91-i486-2.tgz because it uses GUI while the default does not.
