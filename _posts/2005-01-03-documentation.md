"Real programmers donâ€™t document; if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand."



Just some guidelines I use and recommend for writing technical papers:

- white papers are not typically confidential, they are usually for public dissemination, to present a specific solution to a particular problem
- indentation is optional
- length of paragraph depends on complexity of information, standard length is 3 to 6 sentences long, balance between complexity and reader engagement
- better to use 'and' or 'or' instead of '/'
-
