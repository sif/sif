## Decentralization

dapp, decentralized app



https://www.blockaid.io



## Blockchain

https://etherscan.io
https://goerli.etherscan.io

OpenZeppelin

Think of blockchains as a ledger or record book

A proof of ledger even

Immutable ledger

So BTC would be proof of payment

Distributed P2P network

Byzantine Fault Tolerance

consensus protocol

orphaned blocks



### Cryptocurrency

Ecosystem includes: nodes, miners, mines, mining pools

proof-of-work (POW), used by BTC

proof-of-stake (POS), used by ETH (or currently at POW and plans to move to POS)



field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)

ICO initial coin offering

- Bitcoin can process about 7 tps (transaction per second)
- Ethereum can process aorund 15-30 tps
- PayPal's tps is 193
- Visa is 1,700 tps

So scalability is an issue



#### Bitcoin (BTC)

first cryptocurrency

invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, released in around 2008

limited supply of 21 million coins

Bitcoin's Monetary Policy - halving, block frequency 



#### Ethreum (ETH)

focuses on smart contracts

Ethereum 2.0 was built to reduce energy consumption and increase transaction speed

Ether.js

Hardhat, development environment, deployment tool



#### Polygon / Matic Network

https://polygonscan.com

MATIC

Finality variant ensures that once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be altered or reversed



#### Others

- Solana (SOL)
- Ripple (XRP)
- Cardano (ADA)
- Dogecoin (DOGE)
- USD Coin (USDC), stablecoin, always worth $1

Polygon can compete and complement Ethereum



### Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

ERC-721, this means each token is unique, represents different assets with distinct values

OpenSea

NFT is just a digital asset

NFTs are unique and not interchangeable

Think collectibles, art, etc. Any unique item where each token has a different identifier and metadata



#### Smart Contracts

Solidity

Libra



##### Tokenization

real world assets (RWAs)

apparently BlackRock and Fidelity (along with startups like Tzero, Securitize, and Polymath) are using blockchaint to tokenize assets

physical asset oracle problem / blockchain oracle problem

"If Alice tokenizes her car, and Bob buys the token; how can Bob be sure he will receive the car?"



### Fungible

ERC-20

Fungible tokens are identical and interchangeable



### Versatile

ERC-1155

Supports both non-fungible and fungible tokens within the same contract

A single contract to handle multiple token types

Think games



### Mining

To mine, you need: hardware, software, wallet (hardware or software)

CPUs vs GPUs vs ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit)

Nonce

Golden nonce

Nonce range

Picking transactions

Mempools



### Wallets

MetaMask

good for ETH
