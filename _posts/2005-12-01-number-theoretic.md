## Matrix Multiplication

"Matrix multiplication is a mathematical operation that allows two matrices to be combined to create a new matrix. It is performed by taking the dot product of each row in the first matrix with each column in the second matrix."

## Strassen's Multiplication

"Strassen's multiplication is an algorithm used to multiply two matrices that is faster than the standard method of matrix multiplication."



## Euclidean Algorithm

"The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers."



## Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm



## Chinese Remainder Theorem



## Quadratic Sieve Algorithm



## Pollard's Rho Algorithm

"Pollard's Rho algorithm is a method for quickly finding the prime factors of a large number."



## Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) Algorithm

"This refers to a method for factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. The ECM is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves, which can be used to find the prime factors of a number more quickly than with traditional factoring algorithms. It is a popular method for factoring in cryptography, where it is used to break the encryption of certain types of messages."

"In many encryption schemes, the security of the encrypted message relies on the difficulty of factoring the large composite numbers that are used."
