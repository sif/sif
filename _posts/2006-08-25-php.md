PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"

- Order do matter (such as order of the functions)
- Donâ€™t let anything get lost in void, make it used by actually cramming it into one statement if possible
- You can't jump parameters
- With parse-url you can create a script that verifies the URL
- Don't use isset, use empty
- phpinfo()
- php.ini: `upload_max_filesize = 500M`
