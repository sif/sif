A linked list stores data within nodes that point to other nodes at its most basic

A node is a data structure that has two parts, the data and a reference to another node

A linked list chains these nodes together



## Runtime Complexity

lookup 
append 
insert 
delete 



## Space Complexity



## Special Cases

- A linked list is empty when head is null.
- List with only one element.
- Element activity at the beginning of the list.
- Element activity at the end of the list.
- Element that does not exist in the list, thus resulting in no activity.



## Restrictions

Canâ€™t use binary search since linked lists does not allow random access



## Singly



### Non-circular Singly Linked List



## Doubly

A doubly linked list has nodes that also references the previous node



## Circular

A circular linked list is a linked list whose tail (last node) references the head (first node)



### Circular Singly Linked List



## Exercises

- Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions).
- Find the nth element in a linked list.
- Remove the nth element of a linked list.
- Check if a linked list has cycles.
- Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop. For example: A-B-C-D-E-C, C is the node that begins the loop.
- Check whether a link list is a palindrome.
- Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively.
