[Sunsetting Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)

In case this [site](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python) goes down, run the following:
```
apm install linter
pip install flake8 --user
pip install flake8-docstrings --user
apm install linter-flake8
```

I don't use it anymore since it kept getting in my way.

Disable the tree-view package
