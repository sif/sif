"Antimatter is a type of matter composed of antiparticles, which are particles that have the same mass as particles of normal matter but have opposite electric charge and other differences in their quantum properties. When a particle of normal matter and an antiparticle meet, they can annihilate each other, releasing a burst of energy."

## The early universe

"It is currently not known what happened before the Big Bang, which is the moment approximately 13.8 billion years ago when the universe is believed to have come into existence. This is because the laws of physics as we understand them break down at the singularity, a point in space and time where the density of matter and energy is thought to be infinite."
"One possible explanation for what happened before the Big Bang is that our universe is just one part of a larger multiverse, and that the Big Bang was the result of a collision or interaction between our universe and another universe."
"Another possibility is that the Big Bang was not the beginning of everything, but rather it was a transition between two different phases of the universe. In this scenario, the universe may have existed in a different form before the Big Bang, and the laws of physics that we know may not have applied."
"It is also possible that we will never be able to fully understand what happened before the Big Bang, as the conditions and physics at that time may have been beyond the reach of our current understanding and technological capabilities."

## Dark matter and dark energy

"Dark energy makes up approximately 68% of the universe and appears to be associated with the vacuum in space. It is distributed evenly throughout the universe, not only in space but also in time – in other words, its effect is not diluted as the universe expands."
"Dark matter seems to outweigh visible matter roughly six to one, making up about 27% of the universe. Here's a sobering fact: The matter we know and that makes up all stars and galaxies only accounts for 5% of the content of the universe!"

"The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is an intrinsic, fundamental energy of space. This is the cosmological constant, usually represented by the Greek letter Λ (Lambda, hence the name Lambda-CDM model)."

## The fate of the universe

"There is currently no scientific evidence or theory that suggests that our universe will come to an end. In fact, many scientists believe that the universe is infinite and will continue to expand forever. However, it is also possible that the universe will eventually stop expanding and collapse in on itself, leading to the end of the universe as we know it. This is known as the "Big Crunch" theory. Ultimately, the ultimate fate of the universe is still unknown and is a topic of ongoing scientific research and debate."
