"Thousands of Firefox users accidentally commit login cookies on GitHub"

Be careful of what you push

Try doing this:

```
sudo find / -type d -name .git
```

`--delete` deletes locally, `push origin` would do it remote:

```
git push origin --delete master
```

## Loose objects

If Git GUI complains about this, just close it and run `git gc`.



## Finding Remote

```
git remote -v
```
