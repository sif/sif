On why open source is superior to closed source apps:
if you tear it down and find cast aluminum everywhere, piston rings whose gap spec varies widely, low quality bearings, you can say "hey this is not very reliable" (compared to something made with high quality forged components, etc)
(case in point in cars: engines meant for racing have tighter specs and less tolerance for failure in components)
