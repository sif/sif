## NVIDIA

My NVIDIA was not working; I got `Error: glXCreateContext failed`. This error pops up in three cases:

1. Bad installation
2. Overwritten proprietary driver with Xorg (say, by upgrading Xorg)
3. Dying video card

So to fix it.. first run `glxinfo | grep -I renderer` to double check on your machine. Usually re-installing would work but in my case, my video card was fried.
