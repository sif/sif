## Biological Psychology

"Biological psychology, also known as physiological psychology or behavioral neuroscience, is a psychological approach that focuses on the biological processes that underlie behavior and mental states. This approach, which originated in the 19th century, is based on the idea that behavior and mental processes are the result of activity in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Biological psychologists use a variety of methods to study the brain and behavior, including experiments, neuroimaging techniques, and animal models. This approach has been influential in many areas of psychology, and has led to the development of many important theories and therapies, including pharmacological treatments for mental illness."



"Dopamine and serotonin are chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters, that help regulate many bodily functions. Dopamine is involved in movement, coordination, and a person's feelings of pleasure and reward. Serotonin is involved in emotions as well, but it also affects digestion and metabolism"

## Behaviorism

"Behaviorism is a psychological theory that focuses on the study of observable behavior, rather than mental processes, as a means of understanding and explaining human and animal behavior. This theory, which originated in the early 20th century, is based on the idea that behavior is determined by environmental factors, rather than internal mental states. According to behaviorists, all behaviors can be explained by their causes and consequences, and can be understood and modified through the principles of classical and operant conditioning. Behaviorism has been a influential theory in psychology, but has been largely supplanted by other approaches in recent years."



### Respondent Behavior

"Respondent theory, also known as respondent conditioning or classical conditioning, is a type of learning that occurs when an animal or person learns to associate a particular stimulus with a particular response. This type of learning was first studied by Ivan Pavlov, who observed that dogs would salivate in response to the sound of a bell, even when no food was present. In respondent theory, the stimulus (e.g. the sound of the bell) is called the conditioned stimulus, and the response (e.g. salivating) is called the conditioned response. Respondent conditioning is a basic form of learning that is thought to underlie many other types of learning and behavior."



### Operant Behavior

"Operant behavior is a type of learning in which an animal or person learns to associate a particular response with a particular consequence. This type of learning was first studied by B.F. Skinner, who observed that animals would repeat behaviors that were followed by a reward, and would stop behaviors that were followed by punishment. In operant behavior, the response (e.g. pressing a lever) is called the operant, and the consequence (e.g. receiving a reward) is called the reinforcement. Operant behavior is a type of learning that is thought to underlie many complex behaviors, including many forms of human decision-making and learning."



### Two-Factor Conditioning

"Two-factor conditioning is a type of learning in which an animal or person learns to associate two different stimuli with a particular response. This type of learning involves both classical conditioning and operant conditioning. In classical conditioning, an animal or person learns to associate a particular stimulus with a particular response. For example, a person might learn to associate the sound of a bell with the feeling of hunger. In operant conditioning, an animal or person learns to associate a particular response with a particular consequence. For example, a person might learn to associate pressing a lever with receiving a reward. In two-factor conditioning, these two types of learning are combined, so that an animal or person learns to associate two different stimuli (e.g. the sound of a bell and the sight of food) with a particular response (e.g. salivating)."



### Behavior Modification

"Behavior modification is a psychological approach that focuses on changing problematic or unwanted behaviors by altering the antecedents and consequences that are associated with those behaviors. This approach is based on the principles of operant conditioning, and involves using rewards, punishments, and other forms of reinforcement to encourage or discourage specific behaviors. Behavior modification can be used to treat a wide range of problems, including phobias, addictions, and chronic health conditions. It is often used in combination with other psychological approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, to achieve the best possible outcome."



## Humanistic Psychology

"Humanistic psychology is a psychological approach that emphasizes the unique qualities of individuals and their capacity for self-direction and personal growth. This approach, which originated in the 1950s and 1960s, is based on the belief that people have the potential to achieve their goals and realize their full potential if they are given the right conditions and support. Humanistic psychology focuses on the individual's subjective experience and seeks to understand their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the context of their personal history and goals. This approach is often used in therapy to help people overcome challenges and achieve greater well-being and fulfillment."

## Cognitive Psychology

"Cognitive psychology is a psychological approach that focuses on the study of mental processes such as thinking, perception, attention, memory, and language. This approach, which originated in the 1950s and 1960s, is based on the idea that mental processes are governed by specific psychological mechanisms that can be studied and understood. Cognitive psychologists use a variety of methods to study mental processes, including experiments, computer simulations, and neuroimaging techniques. This approach has been influential in many areas of psychology, and has led to the development of many important theories and therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy."

"Intrusive thoughts can often produce a feedback loop of fear and anxiety. If most people at some point will meet an intrusive thought, then knowing how to respond to it is a crucial life skill."
"The model showed that most people used a method called reactive control. They would think of a repeated association and then choose to reject it. However, the researchers note that while brains seek to reject this association, they unintentionally reinforce them by bringing it to mind before rejecting it."
"The question is whether it's possible to control our thoughts in a proactive manner, without them coming to mind — and whether we actually do it all the time without knowing it."
"“I think the overarching theme is asking the question, ‘To what extent do we have control over our own thoughts?’ And if we do have some control, what does that control look like?” Kayser tells Inverse."
"Mental wellness is as important to longevity and life quality as physical wellness. Rumination and intrusive thoughts, if left untreated, can affect one’s relationships, ability to work, and basic functioning."
