* TOC

angle sum = (n-2)\*180
n is number of sides

Origin; on a flat x-y coordinate plane, the original, sometimes marked as O is usually (0, 0)

On a x-y-z coordinate system, then the origin is usually (0, 0, 0)

A point has no dimension, only position. A line is one dimension. A plane is two dimension. A solid is three dimension. 

Perimeter
Just add all sides of polygon

Area
Square = $$s^2$$

Parallelogram (rectangle is one such) = length * width



## Plane Geometry

Quadrilaterals

Rectangle, Rhombus, Square, Parallelogram, Trapezoid and Kite

Polygons



## Solid Geometry

Volume
Cube = $$s^3$$
Rectangular prism = $$L * W * H$$
Cylinder = area of base * height
Cone = $$\frac{1}{3} * \pi r^2 * height$$
Pyramid = $$\frac{1}{3} * area of base * height$$

"The key difference between cube and cuboid is: a cube has six square-shaped faces of the same size but a cuboid has rectangular faces."



## Circles

Circle: $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$ (where (h, k) = the center and r = radius)

Circle area = $$\pi R^2 (R = radius)$$
Sphere = $$\frac{4}{3} * \pi r^3$$
$$\pi$$

Right angle


Straight angle


Acute angle


Obtuse angle


Reflex angle


Full rotation


Degrees to radians
rad = $$\frac{\pi}{180^o} (^o)$$

Radians to degrees
$$^o = \frac{rad}{\pi} (180^o)$$

Arc


Positive angle


Negative angle
