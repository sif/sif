I know Wikipedia says precalculus involves algebra and trigonometry, but I consider it to be everything before you take your first calculus class in college.



systems of equations

x-component = rcos(theta)
y-component = rsin(theta)

arithmetic sequences
geometric sequences



* Increasing: 1, 2, 3, 4
* Non-decreasing: 1, 1, 2, 3
* The difference being in that an increasing sequence, for x(n) and x(n+1) > x(n) whereas in a non-decreasing sequence, x(n+1) >= x(n).

x := y means x "is defined to be" y



## Arithmetic

radicals $$ \sqrt[n]{m} $$

Euclidean GCD, gcd(48, 18) steps:
1. 48/18 = 2 R 12
2. 18/12 = 1 R 6 <--- GCD
3. 12/6 = 2 R 0

```
gcd(a, 0) = a
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)
```
