quadratic means a variable multiplied by itself
"involving the second and no higher power of an unknown quantity or variable."

Transcendental numbers

$$ 0^0 $$ = it is either 1 or undefined, the context depends

Algebraic fractions, $$ \frac{50x - 77}{5000} $$

Proportionality, 4y = 8x

Rates of change, $$ \frac{f(b)  - f(a)}{b - a} $$

long division

- *Expression* is 25x + 5
- *Equation* is 25x + 5 = 1000

$$ 1^0 = 1, 2^0 = 1, N^0 = 1 $$ (except for 0)

Exponents
$$ a^b $$, a is base, b is exponent or power
(multiplication, factoring) algebraic expressions

Quadratic formula
If $$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$, then $$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

Binomial expansions
$$ (x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 $$
$$ (x+a)^3 = x^3 + 3ax^2 + 3a^2x + a^3 $$

Absolute value equivalences
If $$ \lvert ax + b \rvert < c $$, then -c < ax + b < c.
If $$ \lvert ax + b \rvert > c $$, then ax + b > c or ax + b < -c.

Distance formulas
d = rt (where d=distance, r=rate, and t=time)
d = $$ \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2} $$ where $$ (x_1, y_1) $$ and $$ (x_2, y_2) $$ are coordinates of points

Equations of graphs
Line: y = mx + b (where m = slope and b = y-intercept) or Ax + By = C
Parabola: $$ y=ax^2 $$ + bx + c or y - k = $$ a(x - h)^2 $$ (where (h, k) = the vertex)

## Functions

- Domain
- Range

x is called the independent variable and y is called the dependent variable. 

Basic form is simply f(x) = y, which is read as “y in a function of x.”

### Square Root

```
def my_sqrt(number):
    """ Custom square root function using the Newton-Raphson method/Heron's method """

    # Condition to exit if the function receives a number less than 0
    if number < 0:
        return "Cannot compute square root of a number less than 0"

    # Acceptable condition, the tolerance can be adjusted
    tolerance = 0.00001
    
    # First guess
    guess = number / 2.0
    
    while abs(guess * guess - number) > tolerance:
        # The formula
        guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2.0
    
    return guess

print(my_sqrt(-1))
print(my_sqrt(0))
print(my_sqrt(2))
print(my_sqrt(4))
print(my_sqrt(16))
```

## Logarithm

To solve for a in a formula: 
$$ log_a (b) = \frac{log_x (b)}{log_x (a)} $$



**The value of $$ log_2 3 $$ (w/o a calculator)** 

Start with upper bound:

1. x = $$ log_2 3 $$
2. This means: $$ 2^x = 3 $$
3. $$ (2^x)^3 = 3^3 $$
4. 27 is less than 32 which is $$ 2^5 $$.
5. This means 3x is less than 5. 
6. x < $$ \frac{5}{3} $$ then x < 1 $$ \frac{2}{3} $$

Now do lower bound:

1. $$ 2^x = 3 $$
2. $$ (2^x)^2 = 3^2 $$
3. 9 is greater than 8 which is $$ 2^3 $$.
4. This means 2x is greater than 3.
5. x > 3/2 then x > 1 $$ \frac{1}{2} $$

We get $$ 1 \frac{1}{2} < x < 1 \frac{2}{3} $$.

## Complex

Imaginary numbers = i = $$ \sqrt{-1} $$

Has the form: a+bi
