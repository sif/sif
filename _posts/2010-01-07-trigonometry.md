trigonometry of triangles

## Pythagorean Theorem

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

In a right triangle with sides measuring a, b, and c, where side c is the opposite of the right angle

## Triangle Inequality Theorem

If x, y, z $$ \in \mathbb{R} $$, then $$ \lvert x-y \rvert \leq \lvert x-z \rvert + \lvert z-y \rvert $$

In short, the length of one side will never be greater than the sum of the other two sides on a triangle. 

## Unit Circle
