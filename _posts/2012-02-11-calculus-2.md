## Integral Calculus

consider continuity, smoothness, etc.

Definition of an improper integral
\int(a to b) f(x) dx is an improper integral if
1. f becomes infinite at one or more points of the interval of integration, or
2. one or both of the limits of integration is infinite, or
3. both 1 and 2 hold

Summation

Types of infinity

Constant integral
$$ \int 1dx = x + C $$

Area under the curve
$$ \int a dx = ax + C $$
$$ \int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, n \neq -1 $$

Integrating trigonometry
$$ \int sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C $$
$$ \int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C $$
$$ \int sec^2(x) dx = tan(x) + C $$
$$ \int csc^2(x) dx = -cot(x) + C $$
$$ \int sec(x)(tan(x)) dx = sec(x) + C $$
$$ \int csc(x)(cot(x)) dx = -csc(x) + C $$

Taylor series
Taylor series gives us a way to approximate around regions of interest.



### Series

Diverges

Radius of convergence, a power series will converge for certain value of x.

- Harmonic series



## Calculus 2 Problems and Solutions

$$ \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt[3](x)} dx $$

The trick is to rewrite the cube root, then integrate from -1 to 0 and 0 to 1

The first integral should go from -1 to b, as limit of b goes to $$ 0^- $$ and the second integral should go from c to 1, as limit of c goes to $$ 0^+ $$
