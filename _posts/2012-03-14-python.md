Tuple packing and unpacking are magical.

Call module.__doc__, rather `help(module)` for docstring.

\*identifier means it will initialize to a tuple, receiving excess parameters, defaulting to empty tuple.

\*\*identifier means it will initialize to a dictionary, receiving excess keyword argument, defaulting to an empty dictionary.

ternary operators (generally frowned upon in the Python community)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator

```
_single_leading_underscore: weak "internal use" indicator. E.g. from M import * does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore.
single_trailing_underscore_: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g. Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')

__double_leading_underscore: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo

__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__: "magic" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. __init__, __import__ or __file__. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.

## Debugging

`pytest <file> --pdb`
this will drop a trace at where it failed

`python -m pdb <file.py>`

or

`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`

Use h for help.



## Errors & Exception Handling



### traceback

```
import traceback

try:
    1/0
except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()
```



## Linting, Styling

~/Library/Python/3.7/bin/pylint code.py
~/Library/Python/3.7/bin/pydocstyle code.py

```
your pathname>pylint -rn --max-line-length=79 --generate-rcfile > name.pylintrc
```

"Put the changes you want before the -generate-rcfile > name.pylintrc statement and provide your own name before the .pylintrc extension. You can create a configuration file either stand-alone, as just shown, or at the same time you evaluate a Python program. The .pylintrc file is automatically saved in your current working directory, though there is an option for adding a directory path (see https://pylint.org and https://pylint.readthedoes.io/en/latest/user_guide/run.html for more details)."

"To reuse your custom configuration file, use the -rcfile option followed by the name of your personal configuration file and the name of the program you're evaluating. For example, to run myconfig.pylintrc on the pseudonyms_main.py program, enter the following: `C:\Python35\Stuff>pylint --rcfile myconfig.pylintrc pseudonyms_main`"



## Techniques

### Chaining

Assignment

```python
>>> x = y = z = 1
>>> x, y, z
(1, 1, 1)
```

Comparison

```python
>>> x = 5
>>> 1 < x <= 10
True
>>> 10 < x <= 20
False
```



## Lambda

A lambda function is a small anonymous function

A lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression

Syntax: `lambda arguments : expression`

Example: 

```python
def identity(x):
    return x

lambda x : x
```



## Colab

To remove folders:

```
import shutil

shutil.rmtree('/folder_name')
```

By design, rmtree fails on folder trees containing read-only files. If you want the folder to be deleted regardless of whether it contains read-only files, then use:

```
shutil.rmtree('/folder_name', ignore_errors=True)
```
