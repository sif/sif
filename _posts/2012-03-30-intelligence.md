There are all kinds of intelligence, I don't know why I took notes when I did but here is everything I got on this topic.

## Medical Intelligence



## Geospatial Intelligence

"GEOINT, or Geospatial Intelligence, refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about the Earth's physical features and human activity on the Earth's surface. It involves the use of geospatial data, such as maps, satellite imagery, and other geographic information, to support military, intelligence, and other national security objectives. GEOINT professionals use a variety of technologies and techniques, including geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and image processing, to analyze and interpret geospatial data and produce intelligence products for decision makers. GEOINT plays a vital role in many aspects of national security, including military operations, disaster response, and border security."



## Communications Intelligence

"It is a type of intelligence gathering that involves intercepting and analyzing communications between individuals or groups in order to gather intelligence about their activities or intentions. COMINT can be obtained through a variety of methods, including electronic eavesdropping, wire tapping, and intercepting radio and satellite communications."



## Signals Intelligence



## Technical Intelligence



## CyberDigital Network Intelligence



## Measure and Signature Intelligence

Radar
Radio frequencies
Geo-physical
Nuclear radiation
Electro-optical sensors



## Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence

Formerly known as telemetry intelligence (TELINT)



## Imagery Intelligence



## Environmental Intelligence



## Human Intelligence

"It is a type of intelligence gathering that involves collecting information from human sources, as opposed to electronic or technical sources. HUMINT can be obtained through a variety of methods, including conversations with people, interrogations, debriefings, and other interactions with individuals who have knowledge or information that is of intelligence value.

HUMINT is considered to be one of the most valuable sources of intelligence because it can provide insight into the motivations, intentions, and capabilities of individuals or groups. It is often used to complement other intelligence-gathering methods, such as SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) and IMINT (Imagery Intelligence), to provide a more complete picture of a situation or event."



## Financial Intelligence



### Anti-Money Laundering

KYC, know your customer
PEP, politically exposed person
CIP, customer identification program
CDD, customer due diligence
SAR, suspicious activity report
High-risk jurisdiction

Generative AI may make KYC useless

It could even beat liveness checks



## Electronic Intelligence

"It is a type of intelligence gathering that involves the collection and analysis of electronic signals and emissions from electronic systems and devices. ELINT can be used to gather information about a wide range of subjects, including military capabilities, communication systems, radar systems, and other electronic systems and devices.

ELINT is often collected using specialized electronic monitoring equipment, such as antennas, receivers, and other sensors. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including force protection, situational awareness, target acquisition, and battle damage assessment.

ELINT is an important tool for military and intelligence organizations, as it can provide real-time or near real-time information about a given area or situation. It can be used to identify and locate electronic systems and devices, as well as to gather technical information about their capabilities and limitations. In addition to traditional methods of ELINT collection and analysis, modern techniques also make use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of analysis and interpretation."



## Threats Intelligence

### Internal

"Internal threats intelligence refers to the collection and analysis of information about potential threats to an organization or group from within its own ranks. This can include threats from employees, contractors, or other individuals with access to the organization's facilities, information, or systems.

Internal threats intelligence can be gathered through a variety of methods, including interviews, data analysis, and surveillance. It is often used to identify potential insider threats, such as espionage, sabotage, or fraud, and to take measures to prevent or mitigate these threats.

Internal threats intelligence is an important aspect of an organization's security program, as it can help to protect the organization's assets, intellectual property, and sensitive information from being compromised by individuals within the organization. It can also help to identify and address other issues, such as policy violations or workplace misconduct, that may pose a risk to the organization."



### External

"External threat intelligence refers to the collection and analysis of information about potential threats to an organization or group from external sources. This can include threats from competitors, hackers, nation-states, or other groups or individuals who are not affiliated with the organization.

External threat intelligence can be gathered through a variety of methods, including open-source intelligence (OSINT), social media monitoring, and intelligence exchanges with other organizations. It is often used to identify potential threats to the organization's assets, intellectual property, or sensitive information, and to take measures to prevent or mitigate these threats.

External threat intelligence is an important aspect of an organization's security program, as it can help to identify and assess potential risks from external sources and to develop appropriate response strategies. It can also help to inform decision-making and prioritize security efforts to protect the organization from external threats."
