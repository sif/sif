Creating apps
  - Know how to use your IDE (Xcode)
  - Know your language (Swift)
  - Know some UI



- Compiled vs interpreted
- High level vs low level
- General purpose vs domain specific
- Statically typed vs dynamically typed
- Automatic garbage collection vs manual garbage collection
- Readability vs performance (or clarity vs correctness)



Memory Management

- Heap memory
- Stack memory
- Pointers
- Bit manipulation

pass by value
the parameter value copies to another variable

pass by reference
the actual parameter passes to the function

If input array is sorted then:

- Binary search
- Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then:

- Backtracking

If given a tree then:

- DFS
- BFS

If given a graph then:

- DFS
- BFS

If given a linked list then:

- Two pointers

If recursion is banned then:

- Stack

If must solve in-place then:

- Swap corresponding values
- Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then:

- Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then:

- Heap

If asked for common strings then:

- Map
- Trie

Else:

- Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
- Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

Have large amount of data to compare with another, such as email? Hash them, compare.
