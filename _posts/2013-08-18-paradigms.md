A programming paradigm is about how you structure and write your code

Paradigms shapes the way we approach problems and design their solutions

 

## Object-Oriented Programming

> "I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is "messaging"."
> Alan Kay

The emphasis on OO by Alan Kay was messaging (also known as polymorphism, as the point is to allow objects to communicate with one another)

OOP tries to reduce complexity and encourage code reuse through 4 pillar stones. OOP typically compose of the class and its interface.

* Encapsulation - a way of hiding details such as behavior from outsiders, such as users. 
* Polymorphism - the idea that the same method can give different result depending on the class, usually inherited class. 
* Inheritance - 
* Abstraction -  

- Encapsulation vs abstraction - encapsulation hides internal data details and abstraction hides external data details; in practice, the “private,” “public” stuff are encapsulation and functions, methods are abstraction.



## Imperative Programming

This answers the **how** question, you tell it how to achieve the result

Think sequence, step-by-step



## Declarative Programming

This answers the **what** question, you declare what you want

This is where you describe what you want, rather than how to do it (functional programming for example)

What you expect from your code



### Functional Programming



### Reactive Programming



Mutiny
- Uni
- Multi



## Metaprogramming



## Natural-Language Programming

"Natural language programming, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm in which a programming language is designed to be more easily understood by humans, using a syntax and semantics that are closer to natural human language. Natural language programming languages are intended to be more intuitive and easier to learn and use than traditional programming languages, making them more accessible to non-programmers. Examples of natural language programming languages include English-like languages such as COBOL and SQL, and more recent languages such as Wolfram Language and Julia."



## Logic Programming

Logic programming constrains programs to follow the rules of formal logic



## Data-Driven Programming



## Aspect Oriented Programming
