## Nvidia CUDA

Compute Unified Device Architecture

"CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by Nvidia. It is designed to enable general-purpose computing on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are typically used for gaming and other interactive applications. By using CUDA, developers can leverage the massive parallelism of GPUs to perform complex computations more quickly and efficiently than with a traditional CPU. This makes CUDA well-suited for a variety of applications, such as machine learning, scientific simulations, and data analytics. CUDA is available on a wide range of Nvidia GPUs and is supported by a large ecosystem of tools and libraries."
