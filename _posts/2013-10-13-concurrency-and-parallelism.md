["The terms "concurrent computing", "parallel computing", and "distributed computing" have much overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing#Parallel_and_distributed_computing)

Concurrency is two lines of customers with one register.

Concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.

Parallelism is two lines of customers with two registers.

A multicore processor is an example of parallelism.

While async strains memory the hardest
