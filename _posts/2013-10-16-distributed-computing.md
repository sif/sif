a cluster is a collection of nodes
a node is a single system

"There are only two hard problems in distributed systems:

2.) Exactly-once delivery
1.) Guaranteed order of messages
2.) Exactly-once delivery"



## Data Grid

Data grid is a system composed of multiple servers that work together to manage information and related operations such as computations in a distributed environment



### GemFire

"GemFire is a distributed in-memory data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications. It is designed to support a wide range of applications, from high-volume OLTP systems to real-time analytics. GemFire offers high performance, scalability, and reliability, and can be used in a variety of settings, including on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments."

On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP)



### Apache Ignite



### Coherence



### Hazelcast



## Messaging System



### IBM WebSphere MQ



### Apache Kafka

"Apache Kafka is a popular open-source streaming platform that is designed to handle high-volume, real-time data streams. It is often used for building real-time streaming applications that process and analyze large amounts of data. Kafka is a distributed system, which means that it can run on a cluster of machines and scale horizontally to handle increasing amounts of data. It offers a number of features, such as high performance, reliability, and scalability, that make it well-suited for a variety of use cases, such as event streaming, data integration, and real-time analytics."



### RabbitMQ



### ActiveMQ



### Apache Pulsar



### Apache RocketMQ



## Peer-to-peer



### InterPlanetary File System

"The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. It allows users to store and share files on a network of decentralized nodes, rather than on a central server. This can make it easier to access and share large or sensitive files, and can also make the web more resilient by removing the need for a single point of failure. IPFS is often used in conjunction with other technologies, such as blockchain, to provide additional security and accountability. It is an open-source project that is being developed by a global community of contributors."



## Edge Computing

"Edge computing is the deployment of computing and storage resources at the location where data is produced."
