"The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that is used to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal or sequence. The DFT is a mathematical operation that decomposes a signal into its frequency components, allowing it to be analyzed and processed in the frequency domain. The FFT is a computationally efficient method for computing the DFT, allowing it to be performed quickly and accurately."
