As time passed, I found myself enjoying working with Flask.
 
It does have its issues, and some of them are host-dependent. For example, waitress and Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) are easier to setup and use than gevent with my host. 

## A Minimal Application

From the official site:
```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

## Running your app in Flask

`flask --app hello run`

Older versions of Flask will not recognize `--app`.

## gevent

If you manage to get gevent and all its dependencies installed, just do the following in:
```
from gevent.pywsgi import WSGIServer
from hello import create_app

app = create_app()
http_server = WSGIServer(("127.0.0.1", 8000), app)
http_server.serve_forever()
```

## waitress

Easier yet:
`waitress-serve --host 127.0.0.1 hello:app`

## url\_for

`url_for('static', filename='favicon.ico')`
