["GÃ¶del's Lost Letter and P=NP"](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com)



## P ?= NP

"Simply stated, it asks whether every problem that can be quickly CHECKED by a computer can also be quickly SOLVED by one."



## Complexity Classes

### P

polynomial

P is a class of problems solvable in polynomial times $$O(n^k)$$ for some constant k



### NP

non-deterministic polynomial

NP are class of problems that can be easily verified but hard to solve

NP is a class of problems verifiable in polynomial time 



### NP-Completeness

NP-complete: problem is in NP and is as hard as any problem in NP

NP-complete problems are the hardest problem in NP

Satisfiability is a NP-complete problem



## 

If you can solve one, you can solve all



## Decidability



### Halting Problem

"A key part of the proof is a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which is known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first cases of decision problems proven to be unsolvable."



## Reduction



## Intractability

Very similar problems can have very different complexity

approximation



## Quantum Complexity Theory

### BQP

bounded-error quantum polynomial time
