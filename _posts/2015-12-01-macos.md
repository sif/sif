Pretty sure ExitUpsellKeyValueStore has to do with Apple TV, for anyone who is googling and not finding much information.
Delete the file, then open Apple TV and select the first episode of any show. You should see the file, it's recreated.

~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary

Open Spotlight Search. Type: "Network Utility"

./ vs source:

- ./ runs the script as an executable file in a new shell
- source runs the script from the current shell

## Homebrew, MacPorts

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
```

Install MacPorts, then do this:

1. `sudo port selfupdate`
2. `sudo port upgrade outdated`



## Virtual Box

command+tab issue



## iTunes

If you have multiple devices.. and you want to sync all of the songs correctly, this is what you need to do. Make sure that all of the devices are empty (0 songs and music videos). Delete everything on the devices then again in iTunes. 

For some reason, just because you deleted everything on the devices, doesn't mean it's really deleted. Some of it will still show up on iTunes. You need to delete everything there too. After that, select all of the songs you want, then "add to device."



## Finder

https://superuser.com/questions/382120/mac-os-x-not-reporting-directory-sizes-correctly

Be careful, delete all .DS_Store:

```
find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
```

To restore a folder to the default view settings:

- Open the View Options panel (View->Show View Options)
- Hold down Option key (the button “Use as Defaults” changes when this key is pressed) and click on “Restore to Defaults”

- Go to: /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/
- Drag any of the item to the toolbar at the top.

`defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` (NO after you don't need it anymore)

Someone asked, yes you can recreate the Downloads folder. If you accidentally deleted the content inside the folder, try to see if it's in the Time Machine.

If you have iCloud turned on, it may move your Downloads and Documents folder around too.



## 

Users can export unmodified/original photos

To look at language related stuff, System Preference -> Keyboard



## Optimizing

Launchpad -> Activity Monitor, similar to Task Manager in Windows

Memory optimizer app not necessary

A user complained about throttling of some kind, might be SpeedStep (an Intel specific thing)



## Hardening

https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/

Had to learn this the hard way. To Apple, there is a difference between Two-Factor Authentication and Two-Factor Verification.

Be very, very careful but when you encounter “Operation not permitted,” typically in Terminal, go to: System Preferences->Security & Privacy->Privacy->Full Disk Access
Add Terminal to FDA. Don’t forget to remove it.

## Troubleshooting

You can restore stuff from here: /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/

### rsync crashes Mac

This is because the rsync that ships with the M1 is from 2006 ("version 2.6.9  protocol version 29"). The latest version as of this writing is ("version 3.2.3  protocol version 31").

To get the latest version, brew install rsync.
