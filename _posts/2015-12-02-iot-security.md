The problem with IoT these days is that it is extremely poorly designed. Here is a small list:

- lack of security by design
- inadequate authentication and authorization
- lack of patch management
- insufficient encryption
- poor password management
- lack of device isolation
- unsecured third-party components
- limited resources for security

This is across the board, not just a single brand or model. I will flesh this out unless my interest (or grades) wanes.
