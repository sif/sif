Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Just make a decision and let it go.

Be brave. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.

No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. There we go. There we go. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You have to make these big decisions.

The least little bit can do so much. Just make little strokes like that. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.

Let's have a happy little tree in here. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. In this world, everything can be happy. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.
