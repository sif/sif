"Decentralized computing is a type of computing architecture that involves distributing computational tasks and data across a network of nodes, rather than relying on a single central node or server. This allows for greater scalability, resilience, and security, as the network can continue to operate even if some of the nodes fail or are compromised.

Decentralized computing can be contrasted with centralized computing, in which all computational tasks and data are handled by a single central node or server. This can be more efficient in some cases, but it also means that the entire system is vulnerable to failure or attack if the central node is compromised."
