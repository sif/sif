"Do any of you guys find difficulty in reconciling Max Planck’s physics work with his “out there” views on consciousness?
“All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force... We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.”
There are other quotes like that too."
"The quote is not that woo-woo. It is a variation of an stance in the hard problem of consciousness most closely related to Conscious Realism. Here it is defined in an article about Donald D. Hoffman (a neuroscientist) who studies the questions Planck raises:
Conscious Realism is described as a non-physicalist monism which holds that consciousness is the primary reality and the physical world emerges from that. The objective world consists of conscious agents and their experiences. "What exists in the objective world, independent of my perceptions, is a world of conscious agents, not a world of unconscious particles and fields. Those particles and fields are icons in the MUIs of conscious agents, but are not themselves fundamental denizens of the objective world. Consciousness is fundamental.
It is very common for physicists dealing with quantum physics to run into these philosophical issues because information and knowledge become actual physical entities under many interpretations of quantum systems. Thus, contemplating them beyond the abstract, or rather, contemplating "are abstract objects real", or "what separates information from matter", and so forth, have real bearing on the understanding of quantum systems.
All Planck's comments show is that he was wrestling with the boundaries of quantum systems, which beg questions about determinism, information, knowledge, limits, and the role of human perception. Is it really so strange that Planck might have seemingly strange ideas about phenomenon that are completely strange?
We have not a single answer to the questions Planck raises, and until we do, we should not wag our fingers at him, or snicker (not saying that's what you are doing OP)."

## Mechanics

"The principle of least action states that the path taken by a particle between two points will be the path that minimizes the action, which is a measure of the energy required to move the particle. This principle can be used to describe the motion of particles and predict the outcomes of experiments in physics."

## Electricity, Magnetism, Fluids

"Electric and magnetic fields are regions around electric charges and magnets where the force of these charges and magnets can be felt. They can be described by their strength (measured in volts per meter for electric fields and teslas for magnetic fields) and direction."

## Waves, Optics, Thermodynamics

"Waves are periodic disturbances that can transfer energy and information through a medium. They have properties such as wavelength (the distance between consecutive peaks of a wave), frequency (the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given period of time), and amplitude (the height of a wave)."

## Particle Physics

"The strong nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, and it is responsible for holding the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom together. It is the strongest of the four forces, but it has a very short range, only acting over distances smaller than the size of a proton."

"The Higgs field is a field of energy that permeates all of space and gives particles mass. It was first proposed by physicist Peter Higgs in 1964, and it was confirmed to exist through the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012."

"Protons are not thought to be completely stable. It is believed that they can decay, although the process is extremely slow. In fact, the current best estimate for the proton's half-life is on the order of 10^34 years, which is vastly longer than the age of the universe. "
"Because the proton's half-life is thought to be so incredibly long, it is unlikely that we will see proton decay in the near future, if at all. As a result, the implications of proton decay, if it were to occur, are largely theoretical at this point."

## Theory of Relativity

### Special Relativity

"Special relativity is a theory that explains how the laws of physics appear the same to all observers, regardless of their relative motion. It was developed by Einstein in 1905 and is based on the idea that the laws of physics should be the same for all inertial (non-accelerating) observers. Special relativity is based on two postulates: the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, and the constancy of the speed of light, which states that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of their relative motion."

"The speed of light in a vacuum is the highest speed at which energy, matter, and information can travel. It is a fundamental constant of nature, and it has been measured to be approximately 299,792,458 meters per second."

speed of light is 670,616,629 mph

### General Relativity

naked singularity

"According to the theory of relativity, time and space are not fixed, but rather they are flexible and can be affected by the presence of matter and energy. For example, time appears to pass more slowly for objects moving at high speeds, and the distance between two objects can appear to be shorter due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of a massive object."

"General relativity is a theory that explains the gravitational force as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter and energy. It was developed by Einstein in 1915 and is based on the idea that gravity is not a force, but rather it is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. General relativity has been extremely successful in explaining the behavior of the universe on large scales, and it has made many precise predictions that have been confirmed through observations."

it seems to be uncommon for physicists to learn both general relativity and quantum field theory



## Quantum Mechanics

"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to precisely measure both the position and momentum of a subatomic particle at the same time. This is because the act of measuring the position of the particle inevitably disturbs its momentum."

"Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle can affect the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances. This has been demonstrated through experiments that show that when the spin of one entangled particle is measured, the spin of the other particle becomes determined instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them."

"The Casimir effect is a phenomenon in which two uncharged metallic plates placed a few nanometers apart will experience a force pulling them together. This is due to the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the space between the plates, which leads to a difference in the number of virtual particles present on the two sides."

time crystal
"A time crystal is a hypothetical type of matter that has a periodic structure in time, similar to the periodic structure of a crystal in space. In other words, a time crystal would be a material that has a repeating pattern in time, with the atoms or molecules in the material moving in a regular and predictable way.

The idea of a time crystal was first proposed by Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek in 2012, and it has since garnered a great deal of interest from physicists and mathematicians. While it is currently unknown if time crystals can actually exist in nature, there have been some experimental efforts to create time crystals in the laboratory.

If time crystals were found to exist, they could have many interesting and potentially useful properties. For example, they could be used to create new types of sensors and clocks, or to study the fundamental nature of time and its relationship to space and matter. However, much more research is needed to understand the properties and behavior of time crystals, and it is currently not known if they are possible in the real world."



## String Theory



String theory requires 26 dimensions

### Superstring Theory

Superstring Theory only requires 10



problem is, according to physicists, is that it doesn't match our universe which have 4 (but do we know that our universe only have 4?)

length, width, height + time



### M-theory

"M-theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to unify the five different versions of string theory into a single, consistent theory. It proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but rather tiny, vibrating strings. However, unlike in traditional string theory, which only considers strings that vibrate in 10 dimensions, M-theory proposes that there are 11 dimensions of space-time, and that the strings can vibrate in any of these dimensions.

M-theory also introduces the concept of "branes," which are higher-dimensional objects that can exist in the 11-dimensional space-time of the theory. These branes can have different properties and behaviors, and they can interact with each other and with the strings in various ways."
