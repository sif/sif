### Near-Death Experience

seems to be mainly when the brain is oxygen deprived

what you see depends on what you grew up with, so if you were Christian, you'd see Jesus, if you were Muslim, you'd see Allah, etc.

### Sleep

["What Are Dreams For?"](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/what-are-dreams-for)

Why we sleep:

- restorative theory
- evolutionary reasons, we consume less energy while sleeping
- memory consolidation theory

Why we dream:

- problem solving theory
- wish fulfilment, our dreams manifest latent desires
- activation-synthesis theory

When we sleep, the frontal lobes is the least active (whose job is to enable critical thinking), this means dreams won't make sense
One idea is that when we experience nightmare, it means the frontal lobes is active



### Neurodivergence

I didn't know this but neurodivergence applies if you have any of the following: PTSD, OCD, anxiety/depression, etc.

I thought it only applied to autism (and sometimes ADHD)

(this is according to the Divergent Umbrella from disabilityexplorer.com)



## DNA Computing

"DNA computing is an emerging branch of computing which uses DNA, biochemistry, and molecular biology hardware, instead of the traditional electronic computing."



## Stem Cell

## Pathology

"Pathology is the study of the causes and effects of disease or injury. It involves examining tissues, organs, and bodily fluids to diagnose and understand the underlying mechanisms of disease. Pathologists use a variety of techniques, including microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and molecular testing, to study the changes that occur in the body during disease. Pathologists often work closely with doctors and other healthcare providers to diagnose and treat patients, and they play a crucial role in the detection and management of many different diseases."

"Our dental health changed with our diets. Ancient humans and their hominin ancestors really didn’t have much of a problem with cavities. In fact, finding an ancient skull with a cavity is such a big deal that you can go and publish a whole paper just to show off the discovery. Unhappy smiles became more common only after the advent of farming led to humans eating a lot more carbs — a shift that went even further following the widespread availability of refined flour and sugar in the 19th century.

But in the past decade or so, scientists sequenced the DNA from ancient dental plaque and figured out that something else in our mouths was changing at the same time as our dental health. Turns out, there are specific strains of bacteria — streptococcus mutans, in particular — that are more common in mouths with cavities. And as human diets changed and cavities became more common, those bacteria started taking over our mouths. Our modern communities of oral bacteria are less diverse than our ancestors’ were, and they’re dominated by these cavity-causing strains.

Increasingly, scientists are thinking of cavities as a microbiome problem."

## Evolution

Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
The egg, laid by an animal that is not a chicken.

99% of species on our planet has died, that's around 5 billion species estimated that have died out

["The Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago, with complex life on the planet only beginning to form in the last 500 million years. That represents just 12% of Earth's history, according to Dynamic Earth. Some 400 million years ago, stems had begun to form on the Earth's surface, with roots and leaves evolving (via Earth Archives). There were wingless insects, millipedes, and worms, but mammals and animals with spines did not yet exist (via Live Science)."](https://www.grunge.com/894832/over-400-million-years-ago-giant-mushrooms-covered-the-earth/)

"Why do they draw so much blood for a blood test?

You must understand that there are a lot of tests that are done on blood: RBC, HT, Hb, Wbc, thrombocytes, bilirubin, TGO, TGP, GGT, glycemia, PCR, triglycerides, cholesterol, ESS (we call it VSH), electrolytes etc, some of which require a certain anticoagulant or none at all. if you need to get tested for something else, like antibodies for several diseases, or anaemia then they need more blood, because you can’t use one sample for all determinations."

- RBC = red blood cell
- HT = hematocrit test
- HB = hemoglobin test
- WBC = white blood cell
- thrombocytes = platelet count test
- bilirubin = jaundice test
- TGO = 
- TGP = ALT blood test
- GGT
- glycemia
- PCR
- triglycerides
- cholesterol
- ESS (or VSH)
- electrolytes
