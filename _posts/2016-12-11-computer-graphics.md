"I do ai art, as well as traditional art. I think, and I'm obviously biased in that way. But that as long as it's used as a tool to create, it's no different then the speculation of how the rollout of photoshop was; as a threat to the artistic community. As dangerous as a new font, or texture pack.
I wrote this back in 2018
I used a computer but I thought I was cheating so I used a projector.
I used a projector but I felt like I was cheating so I painted.
I painted but I felt like I was cheating so I made my own paint
I grew my own pigments but I felt like I was cheating so I made my own brush.
I made my own brush but I felt like I was cheating so I grew my own wood and took a cut of my hair.
I made my own brush but felt like I was cheating when ever I used red. So I used my own blood
I used my own blood for red but felt like I was cheating so I threw away my wood brush and used my own bone.
I painted on the canvas but felt like I was cheating so I used my own skin.
I painted myself upon myself and felt like I was cheating because what I saw was something not mine. So I took out my eyes.
I don't do art anymore. I felt like I was cheating."
"Ai art will just be a gateway tool to get people to express themselves in a language they've always known, but we're unable to speak."
