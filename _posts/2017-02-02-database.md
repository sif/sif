Database normalization, shows how well designed your database is
normal forms
Codd normal forms

Entities and their relationships

User, Story are objects
We need to define their relationships so we can feed User and Relationship objects according to their relationship

Every organization has an Entity-Relationship model of their business logic

Every ER model has an equivalent relation (table) in the database
ER model is just a theoretical abstraction of the relationship
ER and OOP are compatible too, what's Entity in ER is Object in OOP

Entity has attributes, entity becomes table in database
Attributes becomes the columns
So if User is an Entity, its attributes are email, password, profile_picture, interests, etc.

Function Independence means that we choose an attribute (column) and make it a function
For example, Users(email) = row
For every email, there must be a single row

An attribute is the Primary Key of the relationship

We could add another entity, Story
The tags of the story and interests of the User can come from the same set
This is called Referential Integrity
Between two Entities, tags of Story and interests of Users will have to come from the same list or the Referential Integrity is compromised

When we find this kind of column, we call it the Foreign Key of the table

In order to vet Referential Integrity, we setup database constraints



A primary key uniquely identifies each record within its own table, while a foreign key links records between tables by referring to the primary key of another table.

## Database Theory



### Relational Algebra



## SQL

Interviewer: "Tell me everything you know about SQL."
Me: "INSERT UPDATE DELETE DROP"
(this is a joke)



### SQLite

```
sqlite3 yourdb.db
```

To dump title of notes:

```
SELECT title FROM notes; 
```

To dump title of notebooks:

```
SELECT title FROM folders;
```

To find duplicate value:

```
SELECT title, COUNT(*) c FROM notes GROUP BY title HAVING c > 1;
```

To find out structure:

```
PRAGMA table_info(notes);
```

To find out tables:

```
.tables
```



### MySQL

13.37 â€“ stopping mysqld:

- Turn it off in Desktop Search in control center.
- Edit: /home/sif/.config/akonadi/akonadiserverrc
- Change it to: StartServer=false
- Then: chmod -x /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld
- Log out then back in.



### PostgreSQL

- brew install postgresql
- pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start && brew services start postgresql
- psql postgres
- createuser sif
- ALTER ROLE sif CREATEDB;
- createdb sifapps -U sif

If it refuses to shut down..

```
launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist 
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
```

Or:

```
launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist
```
