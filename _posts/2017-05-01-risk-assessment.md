Threat modeling

- What is the product/project?
- What could the attacker hit?
- What are the available solution(s)?
- Review the STRIDE matrix

Why do we perform threat modeling? Because it should help you design defenses that make sense for the product and meet regulatory needs

Ultimately, resources (time, analysts, etc.) are limited and threat modeling helps prioritize resources

So, an example for this would be if you run a small local restaurant, then you could put "nation-state" as part of your possible threat on the list

But a nation-state is unlikely to target a small restaurant

So you don't allocate any resource to defending against that kind of threat 

STRIDE

| Threat  |  Desired property |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Spoofing  |  Authenticity |
| Tampering  |  Integrity |
| Repudiation  |  Non-repudiability |
| Information disclosure  |  Confidentiality |
| Denial of service  |  Availability |
| Elevation of privilege  |  Authorization |

A very big part of threat modeling is "intended effect" and "unintended effect"

So this can be applied to **anything**
