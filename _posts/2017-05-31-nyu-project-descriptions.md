<strong>Software Engineering (Spring 2016) + Design Project (Fall 2016)</strong>

My year-long capstone project documents are posted in <a href="https://w.taskstream.com/ts/aseph/Sif">here</a>. My amazing teammates are Kurt Bitner, Marcus Williams, and Brandan Sankars. We worked under the guidance of <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/fred-strauss">Professor Strauss</a> for the year.

We hoped to revolutionize how people chat with one another within local proximity.

The main documents are:
<ul>
<li>Project Proposal</li>
<li>System Requirements Specification (SRS)</li>
<li>System Analysis Specification (SAS)</li>
<li>System Design Description (SDD)</li>
<li>Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)</li>
<li>Requirements And Analysis Specification (RAS)</li>
<li>Project Post Implementation Review (PIR)</li>
</ul>

The administration documents are:
<ul>

<li>Project Presentation / Video</li>
<li>Project PowerPoint Presentation</li>
</ul>

This class was a hybrid class, as there was an online portion in addition to the lecture. One of the projects we did was an OSS assessment. My cool teammates for this project were <a href="https://github.com/JonathanLPoch">Jonathan Poch</a> and Nathan Lee Mawby. We analyzed <a href="https://www.staffjoy.com">Staffjoy</a>.
