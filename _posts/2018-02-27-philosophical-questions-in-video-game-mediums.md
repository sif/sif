Mass Effect is one of my favorite series, and I'm a ride-or-die fan. I thought this piece was very well done, so luckily I saved it. I tried to find the original source for this video but was not successful. I searched "mass effect philosophy" on <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com">their site</a> but it turned up nothing at the time of this post.
