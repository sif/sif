## Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MITM)



### Session Hijacking



## [Denial of Service (DoS)](https://www.afterlifesong.com/cybersecurity/2021/06/01/denial-of-service-attack.html)

An example of local DoS is the fork bomb

1. a single process issues the fork system call
2. this call creates a copy of the calling process and runs it
3. the copy, containing the same simple code as the parent, also calls to fork
4. the total number of forks rises exponentially



### [Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)](https://www.afterlifesong.com/cybersecurity/2021/06/01/denial-of-service-attack.html)

DDoS is like cancer
