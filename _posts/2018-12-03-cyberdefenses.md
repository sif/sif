Security is a mixture of:

- containment (security policy)
- Quality Assurance (testing/auditing code)
- repair (patching quickly as vulns are found)
- methodology (defensive coding, using "managed code" templates, etc.)

Defense in depth

Think about loss prevention

A decent start for defense: use a port scanner, close unnecessary ports, try a vulnerability test / tester suite against remaining / necessary port

Goal is to reduce as much surface area of attack as possible.

Always setup full-disk encryption and firmware passwords

Have mobility.

"Escalate things and murder your phone. Desolder the fucker, smash it to pieces with a ball-peen hammer—then burn the parts in a ritualistic conflagration in the backyard. Later, siphon the phone’s ashes into a little glass vial and hang it around your neck to remind you of your triumph over evil."
"Pray that someday, in some as yet unseen American future, your congressional leaders will grow real, actual testicles and introduce laws to regulate the dystopian corporate monsters that have swallowed the world and eradicated human privacy."
