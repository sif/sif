## 



"A real-world example of federated identity using Azure AD might be a user who logs in to their corporate network using their Active Directory credentials, and then is able to access a cloud-based application, such as Office 365, using those same credentials. In this scenario, the user's corporate network and Office 365 are part of a federated identity system that is managed using Azure AD. This allows the user to access both systems using a single set of credentials, and it also allows the network administrator to manage and control access to the cloud-based application using the same tools and policies that are used for the on-premises network."
