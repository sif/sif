I remember the 80s and 90s tech

It taught me to use the technology **as it was intended**

That's why I don't generally root or jailbreak my devices

People would argue with me about customizations but will not realize the risk that comes with that kind of customization

Stupid topics like icons; I personally leave them as they were but that's up to you, you won't lose the ability to patch because you moved some icons around

But you will lose the ability to patch if it's a rooted device



One thing I learned over the years of doing tech is that no matter how good the technology gets, the people factor is always the hardest to fix.
