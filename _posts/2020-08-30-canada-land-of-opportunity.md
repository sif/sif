The link I used to point to disappeared but I somehow had a copy. Uploaded the video then took it down. Re-uploaded. I always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O950J4bJcn4">link this</a> to people who think Canada is a paradise or Canada is that much better than the US.

The original creator's site seem to have gone down: http://recognize-immigrant-credentials.com

If anybody knows where they went, I would be happy to credit them.
