Constitution of the US - Third and Fourth Amendment



"But your intent means squat in a court of law."

Issue of "intent" vs "impact"

"The standard procedure for the FBI is this.

If you question them, they will tell you to google the local FBI phone number. When the receptionist answers, ask to be forwarded to \<INSERT FBI AGENT AT DOOR NAME HERE\>. That will ring the agents cell phone."

Three letter agencies and spy agencies around the world will do this, not just NSA

So when I write or say NSA, I generally mean the others inclusively
