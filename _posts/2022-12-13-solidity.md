"Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications — all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects."

"State variables are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they're written to the Ethereum blockchain. Think of them like writing to a DB."

"The uint data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative. There's also an int data type for signed integers."

"Note: In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits — uint8, uint16, uint32, etc.. But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons."
