This is only an outline for me right now, but I intend to fill this in over time with my own notes; as I do you may find those parts useful in understanding what Usher Syndrome is.

I'm not going to even try to write as if I'm an expert in biology. I'm just writing this out of a mix of desperation and curiosity. So, in a way, you can consider this my notes on Usher syndrome. Who knows, maybe I can jump in on the fight and move the progress bar a little.

Here is what I think you need in order to understand Usher from a medical and maybe scientific perspective. My hope is that this is human readable and a fast track to the core topic. A lot of literature out there is either too long or too difficult to read.

This will also help me communicate what this disease is. I've had to explain what it is and often to my own dissatisfaction as it didn't fully convey the message I intended. 

## Background

- [Basic Biology](https://www.afterlifesong.com/biology/2023/05/01/basic-biology.html)
  1. Most any intro biology class should do
  2. I recommend intro chemistry too
  3. Optional but physics too (useful in biophysics, for example)
  4. Once you have these, you can skip straight to genetics, I don't think plant biology or marine biology unless you have the time and interest
- [Genetics](https://www.afterlifesong.com/biology/2023/05/02/genetics.html)
  1. DNA structure and function
  2. Genes and chromosomes
  3. Gene expression and regulation
  4. Genetic variation and mutation
  5. Mendelian inheritance and patterns of inheritance
- [Human Genetics](https://www.afterlifesong.com/biology/2023/05/03/human_genetics.html)
  1. Human genome
  2. Autosomal and sex-linked inheritance
  3. Genetic disorders and their inheritance patterns
  4. Genetic testing and counseling
- Molecular Biology Techniques
