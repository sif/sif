## Devices and technologies for individuals with hearing and vision impairments

There aren't many options, and what would help tend to be on the legal and societal side of things. 

### For Vision

1. Magnifiers
2. Large print materials
3. Specialized lighting
4. Braille
5. Cane
6. [Be My Eyes](https://www.bemyeyes.com)

Reading Braille is feeling the dots
The dots are associated with alphabets and numbers

Uncontracted means reading a word letter by letter
Contracted means fewer letters to represent a word



It seems that those who become blind later in life only read tactile (raised) text



From what I understand, white cane means blindness / visual impairment. White and red cane means deafblind.

No such thing as night vision glasses, maybe night vision goggles



### For Hearing

This may be silly but when getting your hearing test and an audiologist put on one of those tight headphones on you, either take your glasses off if you wear them or tell them to be careful and not just snap it on your head

It could damage your frames and you don't realize it until after the fact and you're home 

Some bad audiologists will just put it on you after sitting you down without a care in the world and then rush out to finish the test so they can sell new hearing aids to you 

1. Hearing aids
2. Cochlear implants

Never do cochlear implants

#### Brands

In no particular order:

- Starkey
- ReSound
- Phonak
- Oticon
- Siemens

Starkey and Widex have verbal signals for low battery, all others have tonal 

Don't get one of those amplifier hearing aids on amazon

"I’m actually a hearing aid specialist at Costco! So this is about to be very long winded, but hopefully informative.

So we complete a full exam that tests air conduction (how well you hear through your ears) bone conduction (verifies function of cochlea) speech testing, and masking where necessary. Only thing we don’t test is tympanometry which makes sure your ear drum is the proper.... elasticity for lack of better phrasing. Tympanometry is not normally necessary when determining need for hearing aids.

Since we are NOT MD’s, we ALWAYS recommend getting medically cleared by a doctor beforehand. There’s a waiver you sign saying that we made you aware of such, whether you choose to go or not is your prerogative.

If during otoscopy (when we look in your ears w/a scope) something appears abnormal or there’s too much wax, we must end our exam and write you a medical referral and we can only see you again once you have been seen and medically cleared by an ENT. Same is true for if something appears abnormal with the testing results, so you can be well assured we make damn sure everything is medically ok before we fit you lol.

Hearing loss does not necessarily mean hearing aids are the answer. The most important factor is what type of loss you have. Hearing aids are most appropriate for sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss can use hearing aids but this type typically requires surgery, and central hearing loss has to do with the brain no longer processing as it should so no fixes there.

Pricing is by far the best for the technology level you get. The range varies from $1500 (for a set) to $2700 per set. All of our hearing aids are considered “premium level technology” meaning they have things like background noise reduction, feedback cancellation, and ear to ear communication between the hearing aids. Most can connect to smart phones to control the hearing aid via a remote app or (mostly in iPhone) steam calls or music to both aids. Some are rechargeable while other take batteries that need to be changed every 3-7 days depending on usage. We’re the cheapest bc we don’t pay for advertising, we don’t have to rent an office space, and because we sell the second or third most hearing aids in the US so we can get better negotiated prices.

Hospitals And clinics can range from $2000/pair to $9000/pair and have different technology tiers from basic to premium. More likely than not the $2k pairs are “basic” technology and lack things like feedback reduction or recharge ability.

Not every one should get their aids from Costco. If you have been under a doctors care for abnormal hearing loss/issues most of your life, stick with your doctor. Those who need a cros, bi-cros, or tinnitus masking hearing aids have to go elsewhere since don’t carry those.

TLDR; Costco is cheapest for the level of technology and service you get. It’s recommended that you be checked for wax and medically cleared by a doctor before coming in for an exam."

#### Hearing Aids Care

Condensation is an issue for hearing aids (but it's "normal" due to size)

The electrical dehumidifier that uses heat sucks, it damages the hearing aids



Hearing aids are locked to their providers, so others cannot do something like adjust it

So plan ahead and choose your provider carefully
