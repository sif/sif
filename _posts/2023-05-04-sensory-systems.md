["Blindness is a Spectrum and not all or nothing"](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tjDmdaDhoVo)



OS (oculus sinister) == left eye
OD (oculus dextrus) == right eye
OU (oculus uterque) == both eyes
SPH == sphere, the strength of magnification in the lenses
CYL == cylinder, cylindrical correction, or the amount of lens power needed to correct an astigmatism
AXIS == indicates the angle of astigmatism correction
ADD == addition, used for bifocal and multifocal lenses
