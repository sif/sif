Deaf culture



## Personal stories and experiences of individuals

"AMaA about being a deaf-blind corporate woman!"
"When I was 7, my mom came into my room while I was playing with dolls. She played with me for awhile and then said my name. I looked at her.

"When you get older... you will be going blind," she said, demonstrating with her hands as she slowly closed her eyes with them.

"What? No! PM_A_THOUGHT see! PM_A_THOUGHT see!" I yelled, standing up and stomping on my toys. I was not ready to accept this fact. I can see perfectly fine, thank you very much.

"Careful, there's toys there!" she said, worried I was hurting my feet. She thought I couldn't see the toys there, but I knew because I was just playing with them. "See, you can't see..."

I was too angry to tell her that she was wrong, that I can see.

aaand scene. That's how I remembered the night I learned I was going to lose my vision. It seems as though the next day, I had already accepted this as a fact.

And yes, it does get me down that I cannot see as well as others. It makes me mad that y'all can drive and I can't. One of the personality traits about me is that I am very independent, and being trapped inside my home day in and day out, except for work, drives me bonkers."
