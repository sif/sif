["Substantial Gainful Activity"](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html)
I'm apparently not disabled because of this definition here and below

"In the United States, an individual has legal blindness if their vision with glasses or contacts is 20/200 or worse."

"For New Jersey purposes, you are considered disabled if you have a "total and permanent inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of any physical or mental impairment, including blindness." This differs from the federal definition because neither your age nor your receipt of taxable disability income are considered."



## Social and cultural perspectives on disability and genetic disorders
