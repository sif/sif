### Challenges we typically face

Even though most companies claim to be diverse and inclusive, many are not.



#### Anti-remote work

I don't have a lot I can say to upper management that insist on "on-site only" work. They usually have their mind made up.

I recognize that some work can only be done on-site but a great deal can be done 100% remote.

For those that absolutely insist on-site no matter what, I can say something somewhat silly about that:

1. The compassion argument: If you were to switch your position with this person, would you still insist? Now you have to do everything you're telling this person to do.
2. The religious argument: Wouldn't you want to be viewed favorably if you're religious by allowing people to be closer to their family?
3. The spiritual argument: If you're not religious but spiritual, what about reincarnating into a world you made? Would you be happy being part of the 99%? 
4. The ethics argument: If you're neither, what about being ethical for ethics' sake?

I've used the same arguments in some shape or form and failed as they'd just brush it off, something something about profit being above all. This is really a variant of [SEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem). Basically, "not my problem, I'm the boss, just do what I say."

It reminds me of this skit: "God Visits a Prayer Group - Key & Peele"
