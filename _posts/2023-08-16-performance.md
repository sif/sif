## JMeter

"Apache JMeter is an open-source performance testing tool used to test the performance of web applications, web services, and other types of applications. It is designed to simulate a large number of users accessing the application simultaneously, allowing developers and testers to measure the performance of the application under load and identify bottlenecks that may need to be addressed. JMeter can be used to test the performance of applications running on a variety of platforms, including web servers, application servers, and database servers. It is a Java-based tool, so it requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on the system where it is being run."
