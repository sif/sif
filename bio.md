## About

Hi, if you're interested in me on a personal level.. 
<br />(**For my more professional side: <a href="https://siferaseph.com">siferaseph.com</a>**)

I'm Sif. (But bonus points if you call me "Cassy". I really like that name.)
<br />Afterlife Song refers to one of my favorite music on Mass Effect.

<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/do-we-still-need-opinions-are-my-own-social-media-disclaimer">My opinions are...</a>
<br />On that note, I don't necessarily agree with my own writing. I'll often come back to it years later and think of all the ways I could've improved it, from the content itself to writing style. It is what it is. This means that I'm always open to suggestions.

I grew up in the GeoCities era. Meaning the below will feel somewhat familiar to those who grew up in the same era.

### Fun Facts

1. I'm a foodie. As long as I have something cold to drink, you can feed me almost anything.
2. Did you know FAQ is also "facts and questions," not just "frequently asked questions?"

### Wishlist

- World peace
- Cure for all diseases
- More jobs to be 100% remote

### Philosophy

Life is very short (and fragile). In the grand scheme of things, our time on this earth is just a small sentence in the book of the universe. We spend so much time worrying about little things and chasing after things that ultimately don't matter.

Be more introspective. Be kind. 

#### Alternative Philosophy

On that note, there are definitely things we can do to make it more meaningful and live longer. I am a fervent believer in organized living (literally). 

One of my interest is in life longevity. I don't subscribe to the philosophy of "live fast, die young", maybe when I was much younger.

### Political Views

I'm generally apolitical. It's too complicated to just be two parties. I feel sad that people have to be extremely careful about what they say or it sticks with them forever. We're currently too divided and tribal.

### Identity

No preference to pronouns either. 

### The Chronicles of the Dog-Cat War

I was a dog-only person until this happened:

### This far...

If you've made it this far, let's talk about how I can help you build a better world!

#### <a href="https://www.whatgradewouldnyugive.me">"What Grade Would NYU Give Me?"</a>

I decided to have a little fun after I read an <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2013/12/5/the-harvard-grade-generator/">article</a> about Harvard's grade inflation. Just hit refresh if you're not happy with your grade. I don't believe my alma mater to have this problem, so I created this site to reflect that. The original generator site for Harvard showed that you could only get a grade of A or B.

#### <a href="https://www.siferaseph.com/cat_project/">No Gato</a>

I was trying to convince my significant other (SO) that I didn't want a cat by showing her all the possibilities of cats out there. You know, reverse psychology and all that. She would look at random pictures of different cat breeds and be indecisive. It worked for a while until she brought home a cat from a family friend.

Here she is.

<img src="https://github.com/sif/sif/raw/main/pictures/patsy.jpeg" />

I built it in Flask and Bootstrap. I used The Cat API.

#### Mirrors

I'm simply mirroring these work because I believe in them (or I just really like them). I have also gotten their permission.

I wrote a Wget shell script to mirror the pages.

**Capstone**

Cirquet is a location based social media app intended to broaden the ability for users and business to interact with each other and ultimately bring individuals closer to one another. Businesses often want to reach out to prior customers and bring in new ones. We feel the best way to do so is through non-intrusive social hubs hosted by the establishment. Our goal for this project was to facilitate online communication in an unprecedented way by turning real world venues into chatrooms. The app is currently in development for iOS and utilizes QR readers. We hope to start work on an Android implementation and incorporate NFC and GPS technology into later iterations.
