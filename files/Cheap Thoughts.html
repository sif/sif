<h2><a name="Murphy's Law">Murphy's Law</a></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's First Law:&nbsp; </i></b> Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Second Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Nothing is as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Third Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Everything takes longer than you think it will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Fourth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that
will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Corollary: </i></b> If there is
a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Fifth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>If anything simply cannot go wrong, it will anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Sixth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure
can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will
promptly develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Seventh Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Eighth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked
something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Ninth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Tenth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Mother nature is a bitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Eleventh Law:&nbsp; </i></b>It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so
ingenious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Twelfth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Thirteenth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>Every solution breeds new problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Fourteenth Law:&nbsp; </i></b>If anything can't go wrong on its own, someone will make it go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Murphy's Law can go wrong, it will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing Murphy's Law won't help either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murphy's Law is recursive. Washing your car to make it rain doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Murphy's Time-Action Quandary: </i></b> You never know how soon is too late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>O'Toole's Commentary On Murphy's Law: </i></b> Murphy was an optimist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Proof of Murphy's Law: </i></b> Murphy's Law cannot be proven, yet is correct, as when
you try to prove Murphy's Law, you will see that the proof is incorrect. This is
obviously due to Murphy's Law, therefore Murphy's Law is correct and proven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Stewart's Corollary to Murphy's Law: </i></b> Murphy's Law may be delayed or suspended
for an indefinite period of time, provided that such delay or suspension will
result in a greater catastrophe at a later date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Zymurgy's Seventh Exception to Murphy's Laws: </i></b> When it rains, it pours.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Business and Management">Murphy's Laws on Business
and Management</a></h3>
<p>A carelessly planned project takes three times longer than expected; a
carefully planned project will only take twice as long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A memorandum is written not to inform the reader but to protect the writer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A motion to adjourn is always in order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A perpetual holiday is a good working definition of hell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>André Weil's Law of Faculties: </i></b> First-rate people hire other first-rate
people. Second-rate people hire third-rate people. Third-rate people hire
fifth-rate people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Berkowitz's Postulate: </b></i>A clean
desk gives a sense of relief and a plan for impending disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Biondi's Law: </i></b> If your project doesn't work, look for the part you didn't
think was important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Bove's Theorem: </i></b> The remaining work to finish in order to reach your goal
increases as the deadline approaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>Brien's First Law: </b></i>At some
time in the life cycle of virtually every organization, its ability to succeed
in spite of itself runs out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Completion of any task within the allocated time and budget does not bring
credit upon the performance personnel &mdash; it merely proves that the task was
easier than expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Conway's Law: </i></b> In any organization there is one person who knows what is going
on. That person must be fired.</p>
<p>Cost consciousness and sophisticated design are basically incompatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Cropp's Law: </i></b> The amount of work done varies inversely with the amount of time
spent in the office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>Dr. Samuelson's Reflection:</b></i>
The real objective of a committee is not to reach a decision, but to avoid it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>First Law of Holes: </i></b> The first step in getting out of the hole your dug for
yourself is to stop digging.</p>
<p><b><i>
Second Law of Holes: </i></b> If a boss digs himself into a hole, all subordinates are
expected to jump in with him.</p>
<p><b><i>
Third Law of Holes: </i></b> If a subordinate digs a hole, never expect the boss to jump
in with him.</p>
<p><b><i>
Fourth Law of Holes: </i></b> If you expect to miss the holes others have left in your
path to success, stop looking back at the ones you just climbed out of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Fitz-Gibbon's Law:</b></i> Creativity
varies inversely with the number of cooks involved with the broth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Glasser's Corollary:</i></b> If, of the seven hours you spend at work, six hours and
fifty-five minutes are spent working at your desk, and the rest of the time you
throw the bull with your cubicle-mate, the time at which your supervisor will
walk in and ask what you're doing can be determined to within five minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Heller's Law: </i></b> The first myth of management is that it exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>Hill's First Law of
Salesmanship:</b></i> Treat the customer like a mushroom; keep him in the dark and
spread manure on him at frequent intervals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing motivates a man more than to see his boss putting in an honest day's
work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Rule of Defactualization: </i></b> Information deteriorates upward through
bureaucracies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Sanrio's Rule of Bureaucratic Funding (a.k.a. The Serve Yourself Solution):
</i></b>
The first expenditure of new revenue made available to a bureaucratic agency
will be used to expand the administration of the program rather than for the
needs of the program itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The degree of technical competence is inversely proportional to the level of
management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>The Dilbert Principle: </i></b> Incompetent employees are promoted to the position
where they can do the least damage &mdash; management. (Scott Adams)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ideal resume will turn up one day after the position is filled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>The Law of Predicted Results:</b></i>
Market research can be conducted and interpreted to prove any desired
conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Westheimer's Rule: </i></b> To estimate the time it takes to do a task, estimate the
time you think it should take, multiply by two, and change the unit of measure
to the next highest unit. Thus, we allocate two days for a one-hour task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Cleanliness and Organization">Murphy's Laws on
Cleanliness and Organization</a></h3>
<p>A bathroom hook will be loaded to capacity immediately upon becoming
available. This also applies to freeways, closets, playgrounds, downtown hotels,
taxis, parking lots, wallets, purses, pockets, and so on. The list is endless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bird in the hand is safer than two overhead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A clean tie attracts the soup of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Fletcher's Flagrant
Rumination:</b></i> Efficiency is a highly developed form of laziness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Ninety-Ninety Rule of Project Schedules: </i></b> The first ninety percent of the task
takes ten percent of the time; the last ten percent takes the other ninety
percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>O'Reilly's Law Of The Kitchen: </i></b> Cleanliness is next to impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Paul's Second Law: </i></b> The sooner you fall behind, the more time you will have to
catch up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Schopenhauer's Law of Entropy: </i></b> If you put a spoonful of wine in a barrel full
of sewage, you get sewage. If you put a spoonful of sewage in a barrel full of
wine, you get sewage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When reviewing your notes for a test, the most important ones will be
illegible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Combat">Murphy's Laws on Combat</a></h3>
<p>A grenade with a seven second fuse will always burn down in four seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &quot;sucking chest wound&quot; is nature's way of telling you to slow
down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't look conspicuous, it draws fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Field experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friendly fire isn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only one solution can be found for a field problem, then it is usually a
stupid solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the enemy is in range, so are you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't remember, then the claymore is pointed at you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're short of everything but the enemy, you're in a combat zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incoming fire has the right of way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murphy was a grunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never draw fire, it irritates everyone around you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never forget that your weapon is made by the lowest bidder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never tell the platoon Sergeant you have nothing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are dangerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success occurs when no one is looking, failure occurs when the General is
watching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teamwork is essential, it gives them someone else to shoot at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best defense is to stay out of range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easy way is always mined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions:<br>
a. when you're ready for them.<br>
b. when you're not ready for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enemy never watches until you make a mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more a weapon costs, the farther you will have to send it away to be
repaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing in the world is a Second Lieutenant with a map and a
compass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one item you need is always in short supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worse the weather, the more you are required to be out in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no such thing as military intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to look unimportant, they may be low on ammo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you have plenty of ammo, you never miss. Whenever you are low on
ammo, you can't hit the broad side of a barn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Computers">Murphy's Laws on Computers, Software, and
Programming</a></h3>
<p>A computer makes as many mistakes in two seconds as twenty people working
twenty years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All components become obsolete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any cool program always requires more memory than you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Brook's Law: </i></b> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Demian's Observation: </i></b> There is always one item on the screen menu that is
mislabeled and should read ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disks are always full. It is futile to try to get more disk space. Data
expands to fill any void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Dr. Caligari's Come-Back: </i></b> A bad sector disk error occurs only after you've
done several hours of work without performing a backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure is not an option. It comes bundled with the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Forty-third Law of Computing: </i></b> Anything that can go wr&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Franklin's Rule: </i></b> Blessed is the end user who expects nothing, for he/she will
not be disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Gilb's Laws Of Unreliability:<br>
</i></b>
1. At the source of every error which is blamed on the computer you will find at
least two human errors, including the error of blaming it on the computer.<br>
2. Any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable.<br>
3. Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable
errors, which by definition are limited.<br>
4. Investment in reliability will increase until it exceeds the probable cost of
errors, or until someone insists on getting some useful work done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Hinds' Law Of Computer Programming<br>
</i></b>
1. Any given program, when running, is obsolete.<br>
2. If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.<br>
3. If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.<br>
4. Any given program will expand to fill all available memory.<br>
5. The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output.<br>
6. Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer
who must maintain it.<br>
7. Make it possible for programmers to write programs in English, and you will
find that programmers cannot write in English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a program actually fits in memory and has enough disk space, it is
guaranteed to crash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Corollary:</i></b> If such a program has not crashed yet, it is
waiting for a critical moment before it crashes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's not in the computer, it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Law of Cybernetic Entomology: </i></b> There is always one more bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how good a deal you get on computer components, the price will
always drop immediately after the purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how many resources you have, it is never enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software bugs are impossible to detect by anybody except the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The speed with which components become obsolete is directly proportional
their price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Weinberg's Second Law: </i></b> If builders built buildings the way programmers write
programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finally buy enough memory, you will not have enough disk space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Wood's Axiom: </i></b> As soon as a still-to-be-finished computer task becomes a
life-or-death situation, the power fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Education">Murphy's Laws on Education</a></h3>
<p><b><i>Fourth Law of Applied Terror: </i></b> The night before the English History mid-term,
your Biology instructor will assign 200 pages on planaria.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Corollary: </i></b> Every
instructor assumes that you have nothing else to do except study for that
instructor's course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Fifth Law of Applied Terror: </i></b> If you are given an open-book exam, you will
forget your book. Corollary: If you are given a take-home test, you will forget
where you live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Rahilly's Law of Academic Administration:</b></i>
Remember that not all the faculty have all their faculties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>Terman's Law:</b></i> There is no direct
relationship between the quality of an educational program and its cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>Utvich's Observation:</b></i> Education is the
process of moving from cocksure ignorance to thoughtful uncertainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Experience">Murphy's Laws on Experience</a></h3>
<p><b><i>Carlson's Consolation:</i></b> Nothing is ever a complete failure; it can always
serve as a bad example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experience is a good teacher but her fees are high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experience is a wonderful thing. It allows you to recognize a mistake each
time you repeat it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Fresco's Discovery:</b></i> If you knew what you
were doing, you'd probably be bored.<br>
<i><b>Corollary: </b></i>Just because you're bored doesn't mean you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mistakes are seldom serious unless repeated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trouble with using experience as a guide is that the final exam often
comes first and then the lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Experts">Murphy's Laws on Experts</a></h3>
<p>A man begins cutting his wisdom teeth the first time he bites off more than
he can chew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows
absolutely everything about nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Dr. Reyer's Reflection:</b></i> A professional is one who does a good 
job even when he doesn't feel like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Gummidge's Law: </i></b> The amount of expertise varies in inverse proportion to the
number of statements understood by the general public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't understand it, it is intuitively obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Ryan's Law: </i></b> Make three correct guesses consecutively and you will establish
yourself as an expert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people manage by the book, even they don't know who wrote the book, or
even what book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The least experienced fisherman always catches the biggest fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To spot the expert, pick the one who predicts the job will take the longest
and cost the most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <i><b>Van Oech's Law:</b></i> An expert really doesn't know anymore than you 
do. He is merely better organized and has slides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Weiler's Law: </i></b> Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it
himself.</p>
