1. **Datagrams**: A datagram is a basic transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network. Datagrams are typically structured in header and payloads sections. 
                  Datagrams provide a connectionless communication service across a packet-switched network.

      | **OSI layer** |   **Name**    |
      |---------------|---------------|
      |   Layer 4     | Data segement |
      |   Layer 3     | Data packet   |
      |   Layer 2     | Frame, Cell   |
      |   Layer 1     | Chip (CDMA)   |

1. **IP multicast** : It is a method of sending Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams to a group of interested receivers in a single transmission.
                      It uses specially reserved multicast address blocks in IPv4 and IPv6.

2. **CSMA/CD** : Used to determine when the communication channels are clear, and when a device is free to trasmit data.
