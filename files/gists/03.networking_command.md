### Examining and Monitoring a network

**```ping```**

The ping command sends a special network packet called an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to a specified host.
Most network devices receiving this packet will reply to it, allowing the network connection to be verified.

For example, to see whether we can reach www.google.com, we can use ping like this:

**$ ping www.google.com**

Once started, ping continues to send packets at a specified interval(the default is one second) until it is interrupted.
After it is interrupted by pressing CTRL-C, ping prints performance statistics.

A successful "ping" will indicates that the elements of the network (its interface cards, cabling, routing, and gateways) are in generally good working order.

**``traceroute``**

The traceroute program (some systems use the similar tracepath program instead) lists all the "hops" network traffic takes to get from the local system to a specified host.
